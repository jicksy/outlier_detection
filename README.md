## Simple Outlier Detection

**Aim**: This project aims to compute and visualize outliers in a time series. 

**The task is divided into two main steps:**

1. Calculate CTR and Plot the resulting time series
2. Build a simple outlier detection algorithm based on "moving" average". Classify points that are 1.5 standard deviation away from mean as outliers. Display the result as a plot, highlighting the found outliers. 

### How to run this project?

   * To get the data: Please download the data from https://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction
   * There are two files of code that need to be downloaded and saved to the same folder as the data:
       * **CTR_Analysis.ipynb** (the main ipynb file)
       * **outlier_detection.py** [this file contains the outlier detection algorithm]
   * The cells of CTR_Analysis.ipynb are self explanatory.
